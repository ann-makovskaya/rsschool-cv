## ABOUT ME

I'm **23** year old. I have a technical education background (**Master's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science**). Since mid 2018 I have been working in IT. I started as an assistant business analyst, then did manual testing for a couple of months. Then I became interested in the field of web-development and began to study PНP on my own. And my teamlead at work offered me the position of junior PНP developer.
At the moment, **my experience in PHP development is more than 2 years**. During this time I:
- gained native knowledge of PHP by working on several projects without using frameworks
- wrote code according to the Model-View-Controller concept
- participated in the development of REST API in web-applications
- raised the level of PHP knowledge to middle
- worked with PHP framework YII2
- worked with the boxed version of Bitrix24
- led technical support of the site on CMS MODX Revolution
- mastered several version control systems: GIT, SVN
- worked with several databases: PostgreSQL, Oracle, MySQL
- gained solid knowledge and experience of working with PostgreSQL at the developer level
- got basic knowledge of HTML5
- got basic knowledge of CSS3, including Bootstrap
- got skills in JavaScript, jQuery
- raised the level of English from A2 to B2
- got the skills of understanding and adaptation in someone else's code
- gained experience of working in a team


Now I'm a student in RS-school. I want to systematize and improve my knowledge in front-end development, get the skill of working with js-frameworks and in the future become a full-stack developer. Or maybe I will like this course so much that I want to completely switch to JavaScript :)
